# Data Challenge M2 Mathématiques et Intelligence artificielle
Data challenge for the course Supervised Learning and Data Challenge of the M2 Math &amp; IA in Paris-Saclay University

Link of the challenges:

- Classification d'objet céleste: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/classification-dobjets-clestes

- Prédiction de la qualité d'un vin: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/prdiction-de-la-qualit-dun-vin

## For the project 'Classification d'objet céleste':
Put the data in the a folder named data in the folder 'Classification d'objet céleste'

The file 'Notebook.ipynb' contains the data analysis, the fitting and evaluation of each model mentionned in the report.

Note that the files used for submissions are in the folder 'submissions' but can be regenerated by training the model. 
Figures generated are stored in the folder figures which mainly contains the data analysis stuff and correlation matrix.
Cross validation can take times , especially if done on a PC but the best parameters found are saved in the cell after the training.

## For the project 'Prédiction de la qualité d'un vin':
Same thing as above, just put the folder data in the folder 'Prediction_qualite_vin'
